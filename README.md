## Project Description

Our client, Mark, manages proteges within MYOB. Each protege is assigned a learning budget annually, currently tracked via Excel and Slack requests. Mark wants a web app to streamline managing proteges and their budgets, enabling him to:

- View a list of proteges  
- Create, edit, or delete proteges  
- View and manage expenses for each protege  
- Track budgets and spending  

This app aims to replace the manual Excel process and potentially integrate with another protege app Mark uses.
